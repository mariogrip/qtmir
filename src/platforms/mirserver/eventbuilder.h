      When MirInputEvents are dispatched through a QML scene, not all of its information can be carried

      its original MirInputEvent so that it can be consumed by a mir::scene::Surface and properly handled by mir clients
      we have to reach out to this EventRegistry to get the missing bits.

      as a QInputEvent), it stores information only about the most recent MirInputEvents.
